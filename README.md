# Budgeting-Application
This is a basic budgeting application I created in order to learn how Visual Studio works, including it's Github functionality, the GUI builder as well as coding in C#.

## About this program
This is a basic budgeting application I made in order to help myself budget my monthly expenses and to view them visually. It features two charts that list out the revenues and expenses you currently have, allowing you to create, modify and delete them. There is a section where you can set aside a portion of your current money to put into a savings account, so that it does not count towards your monthly budget. It displays how much money you can spend each month, and displays the revenues and expenses in an easy to read pie chart. You can also save the information in a file, where you can select which user to display information for.

## How to run this program
Currently, you can run this program through Visual Studio. Once you get the source code just load it in and press the Run button.
